# hello-world
Hello World - my first repository 

This is an edit to tell you a little about myself.  I'm Claire, and I am new to GitHub.  I want to learn Java properly, and this seems to be the place to work on things and learn.  I've been a programmer, IT consultant and technical support person for 25 years, but always working on commercial HR and Finance packages, and I need to break out and start challenging myself again.
